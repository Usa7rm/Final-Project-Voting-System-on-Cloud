#Cloud-Based Voting System
Welcome! This system is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for conducting digital elections. Utilizing the latest in cloud technologies and microservices architecture, our project aims to modernize and enhance the integrity and accessibility of voting processes.

Project Overview
Our voting system facilitates the entire electoral process, enabling candidates to register, voters to securely cast their votes, and administrators to manage elections, all hosted on the cloud for maximum efficiency and reliability.

Features
User Registration and Authentication: Secure sign-up and login process for voters and candidates.
Voting Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for voters to easily select candidates and submit their votes.
Admin Dashboard: Enables administrators to set up elections, monitor voting in real-time, and access results.
Results Display: Election results are calculated and displayed dynamically with graphical representations.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js and Material-UI for a responsive user interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express for efficient request handling.
Database: Amazon RDS for reliable data storage and management.
Containerization: Docker for creating containerized applications.
Orchestration: Kubernetes on Amazon EKS for managing service deployments.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
Load Balancing: AWS Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You need to have Docker, Node.js, and npm installed on your machine to build and run the project.

bash
Copy code
npm install npm@latest -g
Deployment Instructions
Follow these steps to deploy the project on AWS using Docker and Amazon ECR.

Step 1: Build the Docker Images
Navigate to the directories containing the Dockerfiles for each service and build the images. Here's how you can build and tag each image:

bash
Copy code
# For the authentication service
cd path_to_authentication_service/
docker build -t authentication-service:latest .

# For the voting service
cd path_to_voting_service/
docker build -t voting-service:latest .

# For the results service
cd path_to_results_service/
docker build -t results-service:latest .

# For the frontend service
cd path_to_frontend/
docker build -t frontend-service:latest .
Step 2: Tag the Images for ECR
Tag each image with the full repository URI, replacing $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID with your AWS account ID and $REGION with your AWS region.

bash
Copy code
docker tag authentication-service:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/authentication-service:latest
docker tag voting-service:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/voting-service:latest
docker tag results-service:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/results-service:latest
docker tag frontend-service:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/frontend-service:latest
Step 3: Push the Images to ECR
Authenticate your Docker client to your ECR registry and push the images.

bash
Copy code
# Log in to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region $REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com

# Push each image
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/authentication-service:latest
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/voting-service:latest
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/results-service:latest
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/frontend-service:latest
Step 4: Update Your Kubernetes Deployments
Update your Kubernetes deployment configurations to use the new image versions.

Step 5: Apply the Changes in Kubernetes
Use kubectl to apply the changes in your Kubernetes cluster.

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
To force Kubernetes to pull the latest images, if necessary:

bash
Copy code
kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
