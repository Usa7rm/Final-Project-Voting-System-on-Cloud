# Cloud Services Infrastructure Voting System Project
Welcome to the Voting System project! This is a comprehensive solution designed to manage and conduct secure online voting. The system is built using modern technologies such as React for the frontend and Python Flask for backend services, all containerized with Docker and orchestrated through Kubernetes for scalability and reliability. This document will guide you through the architecture, setup, and deployment of the system.

Overview
The Voting System allows users to securely register, login, cast votes for candidates, and view voting results. It consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for handling different aspects of the system:

Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and session management.
Voting Service: Handles all vote casting operations.
Results Service: Computes and displays voting results.
Frontend Service: Provides a user-friendly web interface.
Architecture
The project is structured as follows:

Each service is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale across different environments including local development and cloud platforms like AWS.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
Real-time Voting: Cast votes and see updates in real-time.
Results Calculation: Automated calculation and display of voting results.
High Availability: Built on Kubernetes for fault tolerance and high availability.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Docker: For creating and managing containers.
Kubernetes: For orchestrating the containers.
AWS Account: For deploying the project using AWS services (optional for local development).
Local Deployment
To run the Voting System locally:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voting-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd voting-system
Build and run the containers:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This will start all the services locally. You can access the frontend by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Deploying to AWS
To deploy the system on AWS, follow these steps:

Push Docker images to Amazon ECR.
Create a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS.
Deploy the services using kubectl:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
Refer to the AWS documentation for detailed instructions on setting up EKS and ECR.
